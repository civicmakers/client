<h2>Civic Project Lifecycle</h2>
<h3>Recommended steps for increasing the impact of your collaboration</h3>
<p>So you want to start a civic project? Excellent! We want to help you succeed. This Civic Project Lifecycle compiles the latest thinking and best-practices from civic innovators around the world into a handy step-by-step guide that you can follow to increase your odds of success. </p>
<h3>Stage 1: Discovery</h3>
<p>Your first step is to define the problem you&rsquo;re trying to solve. Do this by narrowing the problem as much as you can - to a specific type of user if possible - otherwise you&rsquo;ll get bogged down trying to tackle problems that are too broad.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>A problem statement</strong>Start with the basics. <em>What problem are you trying to solve? What are the goals, needs, criteria that you should be considering?</em> Here&rsquo;s a template for an effective problem statement:<br /><br /></strong>We have observed that <strong>[product/service/organization]</strong> isn&rsquo;t meeting <strong>[these goals/needs]</strong>, which is causing <strong>[this adverse effect]</strong>. How might we improve so that our product/service/team/organization is more successful based on <strong>[these measurable criteria]</strong>?<br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Research</strong>Once you&rsquo;ve established some parameters, start collecting information about the problem. Talk directly with the people affected. Ask open-ended questions like &ldquo;<em>What is your experience?</em>&rdquo; to understand their point of view. Most importantly, prioritize <strong>listening</strong> over <strong>discussion</strong>. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br />Also use your Google skills to do additional research: <em>How many people are affected? How many dollars are being lost? What are some of the drivers behind the issue? What are people doing about it already? Do solutions already exist that we can use or adapt?</em><br /></strong></li>
<li><strong>Define your hypotheses &amp; identify assumptions</strong><br />Drawing on what you&rsquo;ve learned in your research, develop a few hypotheses about the problem and potential solutions you would like to test. <em>What&rsquo;s causing this? Who is affected? How might they respond to potential solutions?</em> &nbsp;<br /><br />Then take a long, impartial look at your hypotheses and list out the assumptions you&rsquo;ve made about your target audience and their needs. You will test these assumptions in the Alpha stage.<br /></li>
<li><strong>Prioritize opportunity areas</strong>The final step is identify the areas that have the most potential for impact. Prioritize the solutions you&rsquo;ve come up with as well as the assumptions for each.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stage 2: Alpha</h3>
<p>Now you are ready to test your problem statement, hypothesis and assumptions by creating a prototype. The goal of a prototype is to advance your understanding of the problem and user needs in order to define the basic, most important functionality of your solution. We believe the Alpha stage is best used for defining a minimum viable product (MVP), which you will then build in the Beta stage.</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Design a prototype</strong><br />A prototype is an interim artifact that models key features and interactions to be validated by your target audience. Prototypes can be rough, even made of pen and paper or post-it notes, as long as they help you engage with users and identify what works and what doesn&rsquo;t. Whatever you do, the goal is<strong> learning</strong>, not <strong>building</strong>. <br /><br /></li>
<li><strong>Recruit and test with users </strong>Your prototype is only as good as the feedback it allows you to collect. Talk to users early and often to validate your assumptions. If their feedback contradicts your hypotheses, you&rsquo;re doing it right! You should go through multiple iterations, focusing on aspects of the problem you know the least about, and modify your prototype based on your findings.<br /></strong></li>
<li><strong>Define your MVP</strong>At a certain point, you will start seeing positive trends in the user feedback you&rsquo;ve been collecting. That&rsquo;s when it&rsquo;s time to define your minimum viable product (MVP). Concentrate on the features that will be most important initially to help users solve their problem.<br /></li>
<li><strong>Create project plan and assemble your team</strong> <br />With things coming into focus, draft a a project plan to identify important milestones and risks, outline key roles and responsibilities, and provide focus for your team.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stage 3: Beta</h3>
<p>Congratulations, now that you validated your hypotheses through prototyping and defined an MVP, you&rsquo;re ready to build! You should implement only the highest value items based on the learnings you generated in previous phases. Remember, done is better than perfect, so prioritize relentlessly and beware of scope creep. Your at this stage is to get something out in the world. Pick a release date and do your best to stick to it. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Build your MVP</strong><br />You&rsquo;ll want to work from a prioritized backlog of user stories (a user story is a piece of functionality that enables a user interaction) and time-box your efforts into short development cycles called &ldquo;sprints.&rdquo; </strong></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Define success criteria &amp; performance metrics</strong><br /><em>How will you measure impact? And what will be necessary to sustain your product with your target audience?</em> These metrics will be important to keep in mind as you build and measure.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Secure a government/community partner (if applicable)</strong>At this stage, it&rsquo;s really helpful to have a partner already working in your problem area, ideally someone that you talked to during the Discovery stage. Maybe you are building something to help their programs, or looking for their help to promote your project. Either way, a partner gives you credibility, and makes your project more fun!</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Don&rsquo;t forget your analytics!</strong> <br />Last by not least, be sure that you&rsquo;ve inlcuded a way to track the key metrics you&rsquo;ve identified above. Google Analytics is our favorite, free analytics tool.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Stage 4: Live</h3>
<p>3...2...1...Liftoff! &nbsp;You made it to launch, but your work is not done. Now is the time to tell the world about your project, focus on learning, and plan for your project&rsquo;s future.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Launch!</strong></li>
<li><strong>Promote to partners, stakeholders and key audiences</strong>Your solution can only help if people know it exists. Work with the partners, stakeholders and audiences you&rsquo;ve identified while developing your solution to share with their networks.</li>
<li><strong>Project debrief &amp; evaluation plan</strong>Before too long, reflect on the past few months. <em>What went really well? What was challenging? What will you do differently next time?</em> Record your group insghts and share them with other projects so they can learn from your hard work. This is also a good time to outline the key questions that may be answered by data collection and establish a timeline for collecting and analyzing data.</li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;"><strong>Develop maintenance &amp; scability plan</strong><br />Think about the future for your solution.<em> How will your codebase be maintained? How are you planning for scaling your project?</em> Asking these questions now will save you headaches later.</li>
<li><strong>Revised problem statement, product description, and KPIs</strong></li>
</ul>
