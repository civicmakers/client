Holacracy is a new way of running an organization that removes power from a management hierarchy and distributes it across clear roles, which can then be executed autonomously, without a micromanaging boss. The work is actually more structured than in a conventional company, just differently so. With Holacracy, there is a clear set of rules and processes for how a team breaks up its work, and defines its roles with clear responsibilities and expectations.","audience":"","pricing":"free","license":"open","avatar":"https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/3477493791/d3c94b68579b6cb6d646421618d833d6.png","image":"http://www.holacracy.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/HIW-Tensions-Drive-Everything-web.png","link":"http://holacracy.org/","twitter":"https://twitter.com/HolacracyOne","Tags":["organization","ogranizaitons","companies","free","open source","social"],"created_at":1446954343,"display":true,"CFAPI_project_ID":"","CFAPI_org_ID":""},"a10d2694-16e2-47b7-96f5-1ce3c74bfd81":{"Timestamp":"11/7/2015 18:23:58","name":"Long Distance Voter","description":"Long Distance Voter will help you register to vote or get an absentee ballot online.

LongDistanceVoter.org is the most-visited site for accurate voting information.\n\nWith the gutting of the Voting Rights Act, attacks on early voting hours and Election Day registration, and the passage of restrictive voter ID laws, Long Distance Voter's services are more essential than ever.
